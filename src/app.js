// Your app's entry point.  Every ReactQL projects requires 'src/app.js',
// which both the server and browser will import.
//
// In this file, you'll do two things:
//
// 1.  Import `kit/config`, and configure your app.  In this example, I'm
// adding a custom Redux reducer that acts as a simple counter, and enabling
// a built-in GraphQL server that imports a schema for a simple message.
//
// 2.  Export the root React component that goes between <div id="main"/>
// in the server-side HTML.

// ----------------------
// IMPORTS

/* ReactQL */

// Config API, for adding reducers and configuring our ReactQL app
import config from 'kit/config';

/* App */

// Example counter reducer.  This simply increments the counter by +1
import counterReducer from 'reducers/counter';
import Coaches from 'reducers/coaches';
import Clubs from 'reducers/clubs';
import Fizio from 'reducers/fizio';
import Login from 'reducers/login';
import Modal from 'reducers/modal';
import Drawer from 'reducers/drawer';
// Main component -- i.e. the 'root' React component in our app
import Main from 'components/main';

// Init global styles.  These will be added to the resulting CSS automatically
// without any class hashing.  Use this to include default or framework CSS.
import './styles.global.css';

// ----------------------

/* REDUCERS */

// Add our custom `counter` reducer, with the initial state as a zero count.
// Note:  The initial state (3rd param) will automatically be wrapped in
// `seamless-immutable` by the kit's Redux init code, so plain objects are
// automatically immutable by default
config.addReducer('counter', counterReducer, { count: 0 });
config.addReducer('coaches', Coaches);
config.addReducer('clubs', Clubs);
config.addReducer('fizio', Fizio);
config.addReducer('login', Login);
config.addReducer('modal', Modal, { isVisible: false, modalClass: '' });
config.addReducer('drawer', Drawer, { drawerOpen: false });

/* GRAPHQL */

// Enable the internal GraphQL server.  This will do two things:
//
// 1.  On the server, it will set-up the necessary route handlers to 'listen'
// to incoming GraphQL requests on `/graphql`, as well as (by default) set-up
// the GraphiQL IDE
//
// 2.  On the client, it will append the correct server URL so that we can
// call the ReactQL host properly, and let the server handle our requests
config.enableGraphQLServer();

/* SERVER */

// Set our server config, by checking `SERVER` -- this code path will be
// eliminated by Webpack in the browser, so we can safely add this.

if (SERVER) {
  /* SSL */

  // By default, the Koa web server runs on a plain HTTP server. However,
  // you can easily enable HTTPS.  In the following commands, I grab a sample
  // self-signed key/cert combo and call `config.enableSSL()` with the options
  // I want to pass to the `https.createServer()` that happens under the hood.
  //
  // Note: Running https:// in your browser using this self-signed cert will
  // undoubtably raise a security error. But at least we can see it's working.
  //
  // Production note: I generally recommend using a dedicated upstream proxy
  // such as Nginx to handle HTTPS traffic, since the TLS handshake will likely
  // be faster, and you can add HTTP/2 and have much finer-grain control over
  // HTTP. But, if you need a fast SSL service, ReactQL has you covered!

  /*
    Uncomment the next two lines to enable SSL!
  */
  //const cert = require('src/cert/self_signed');
  //config.enableSSL({ key: cert.key, cert: cert.cert });

  // If wanted, you could also run an *SSL-only* server by uncommenting:
  //config.disableHTTP();

  // Or, you could automatically redirect non-HTTP traffic to SSL by
  // uncommenting the following: (Note: pass { port: 8081 }) for development
  // or { port: 4000 } for the default production port
  // config.forceSSL({ port: 8081 });

  /* GRAPHQL SCHEMA */
  // Pass in the schema to use for our internal GraphQL server.  Note we're
  // doing this inside a `SERVER` block to avoid importing a potentially large
  // file, which would then inflate our client bundle unnecessarily
  config.setGraphQLSchema(require('src/graphql/schema').default);

  /* CUSTOM ROUTES */

  // We can add custom routes to the web server easily, by using
  // `config.add<Get|Post|Put|Patch>Route()`.  Note:  These are server routes only.
  config.addGetRoute('/test', async ctx => {
    // For demo purposes, let's get a JSON dump of the current Redux state
    // to see that we can expect its contents
    const stateDump = JSON.stringify(ctx.store.getState());

    // Display a simple message, along with the Redux dump.  Note that this
    // won't contain a full `apollo` response, because it hasn't passed through
    // the React handler -- but it *does* mean we can still manipulate the state
    // from within our root, or fire action handlers!
    ctx.body = `Hello from your ReactQL route. Redux dump: ${stateDump}`;
  });

  /* CUSTOM 404 HANDLER */

  // By default, if the server gets a route request that results in a 404,
  // it will set `ctx.status = 404` but continue to render the <NotFound>
  // block as normal.  If we want to add our own custom handler, we can use
  // `config.set404Handler()` as below.
  //
  // Note:  This only applies to SERVER routes.  On the client, the
  // <NotFound> block will *always* run.

  config.set404Handler(ctx => {
    // Like above, we'll grab a dump of the store state again -- this time,
    // it *will* contain a full `apollo` dump because in order to figure out that
    // a route has hit a 404, it will already have rendered the React chain
    // and retrieved any relevant GraphQL
    const stateDump = JSON.stringify(ctx.store.getState());

    // Explicitly set the return status to 404.  This is done for us by
    // default if we don't have a custom 404 handler, but left to the function
    // otherwise (since we might not always want to return a 404)
    ctx.status = 404;

    // Set the body
    ctx.body = `This route does not exist on the server - Redux dump: ${stateDump}`;
  });

  config.setErrorHandler((e, ctx /* `next` is unused in this example */) => {
    ctx.body = 'Some kind of error. Check your source code.';
  });
  config.getKoaApp(app => {
    // eslint-disable-next-line no-param-reassign
    app.context.engine = 'ReactQL';
    app.on('error', e => {
      console.error('Server error:', e);
    });
  });

  /* CUSTOM MIDDLEWARE */
  config.addMiddleware(async (ctx, next) => {
    ctx.set('Powered-By', ctx.engine); // <-- `ctx.engine` from `config.getKoaApp()` above!
    ctx.store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT_COUNTER' });
    return next();
  });
}
export default Main;
